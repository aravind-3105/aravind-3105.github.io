Iâ€™m excited to share that my paper, **"VLDBench: A Benchmark for Disinformation Detection in Vision-Language Models"**, is currently under review for **ACL 2025**. This research focuses on developing evaluation frameworks for **Vision-Language Models** and addressing social biases in multimodal AI systems.

Stay tuned for more updates on this project!
