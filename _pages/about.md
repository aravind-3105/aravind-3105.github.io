Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- ### About Me -->

Hello! I'm Aravind Narayanan, a Master of Engineering student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I developed a passion for deep learning, computer vision, and robotics.

I've gained valuable experience through internships and research roles, including developing monocular depth estimation pipelines at the Neural Robotics Lab and advancing AI techniques for data management at the Laboratory for Applied Informatics Research. As a Python Developer at the Bernhardt-Walther Lab, I created tools to study mid-level vision systems.

My projects span autonomous vehicle navigation, AI-driven health monitoring, and mood classification in song lyrics using deep learning. I am proficient in programming languages like C, C++, Python, and MATLAB, and have expertise in frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ROS.

Academically, I've been recognized on the Deanâ€™s and Merit List and have held leadership roles as Marketing Head in the Entrepreneurship Cell and Robotics Club Head. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and continuously exploring new engineering and science frontiers.

Thank you for visiting my website!
