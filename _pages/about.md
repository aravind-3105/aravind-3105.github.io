<!-- ### About Me -->

Hello! I'm Aravind Narayanan, a Master of Engineering student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, specializing in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I discovered a deep passion for computer vision, robotics, and deep learning.

Currently, I am an Applied ML Intern at the [Vector Institute](https://www.vectorinstitute.ai/), where I developed **VLDBench**, a benchmark for evaluating disinformation detection in Vision-Language Models, under peer review for [ACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11361). At the [Neural Robotics Lab](https://lairhub.com/), I created a pipeline for **monocular depth estimation** to reconstruct 3D scenes, and I’m also contributing to ML-driven news clustering at the [Laboratory for Applied Informatics Research](https://lairhub.com/).

In my previous role as a Python Developer at the [Bernhardt-Walther Lab](https://www.bwlab.org/home), I developed **pyMLV**, a tool for analyzing multivoxel pattern data, advancing research on mid-level visual representations.

My projects range from GPU-accelerated video processing and reinforcement learning for robotic control to mood classification in song lyrics using GPT models. I'm proficient in Python, C++, MATLAB, and SQL, with expertise in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms like GCP and AWS.

I've been recognized on the Dean’s and Merit List and have held leadership roles in student initiatives, including the [Entrepreneurship Cell](https://aravind-3105.github.io/) and [Robotics Club](https://github.com/aravind-3105/Reinforcement-Learning-for-Noisy-Cart-Pole-Stability) at IIIT Hyderabad. I'm passionate about using AI to solve real-world challenges and constantly explore new frontiers at the intersection of technology and society.

Thanks for visiting my website! Feel free to check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/aravind-3105) and more!

<!-- Hello! I'm a second year Master's student at the **University of Toronto**, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Robotics and Analytics. I am passionate about developing AI-driven solutions for real-world problems and have a keen interest in computer vision, deep learning, and robotics.

 I’m currently working on developing monocular depth estimation pipelines for human-robot walking environments at the [Neural Robotics Lab](https://neuralroboticslab.org/) and advancing AI techniques for data management at the [Laboratory for Applied Informatics Research (LAIRHub)](https://lairhub.org/). As a Python Developer at the [Bernhardt-Walther Lab](https://bernhardt-waltherlab.org/), I created tools to study mid-level vision systems and optimized image processing pipelines.

I am proficient in a wide range of programming languages including C, C++, Python, MATLAB, R, JavaScript, and Bash. My expertise extends to frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS, and PyBullet, which I utilize for developing complex AI and robotics applications. Additionally, I have experience with various tools and databases, including SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Git, and VS Code. This diverse skill set enables me to tackle a variety of technical challenges and contribute effectively to interdisciplinary projects.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from **[IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)**, where I was lucky to be working with [Dr. Nagamanikandan Govindan](https://nagamanigi.wixsite.com/home) on mobile manipulation at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). I also worked with [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/ponnurangam-kumaraguru/) on elections analysis and fraud detection at the [Precog Research Group](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/).

Academically, I’ve been recognized on the **Dean’s and Merit List for five semesters** and have held leadership roles as Marketing Head in the Entrepreneurship Cell and Robotics Club Head. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and continuously exploring new engineering and science frontiers. -->
