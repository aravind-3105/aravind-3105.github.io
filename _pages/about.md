<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- ### About Me -->

Hello! I'm a first year Master's student at the **University of Toronto**, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Robotics and Analytics. I am passionate about developing AI-driven solutions for real-world problems and have a keen interest in computer vision, deep learning, and robotics.

 I’m currently working on developing monocular depth estimation pipelines for human-robot walking environments at the [Neural Robotics Lab](https://neuralroboticslab.org/) and advancing AI techniques for data management at the [Laboratory for Applied Informatics Research (LAIRHub)](https://lairhub.org/). As a Python Developer at the [Bernhardt-Walther Lab](https://bernhardt-waltherlab.org/), I created tools to study mid-level vision systems and optimized image processing pipelines.

I am proficient in a wide range of programming languages including C, C++, Python, MATLAB, R, JavaScript, and Bash. My expertise extends to frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, ROS, and PyBullet, which I utilize for developing complex AI and robotics applications. Additionally, I have experience with various tools and databases, including SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Git, and VS Code. This diverse skill set enables me to tackle a variety of technical challenges and contribute effectively to interdisciplinary projects.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from **[IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/)**, where I was lucky to be working with [Dr. Nagamanikandan Govindan](https://nagamanigi.wixsite.com/home) on mobile manipulation at the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). I also worked with [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/faculty/ponnurangam-kumaraguru/) on elections analysis and fraud detection at the [Precog Research Group](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/).

Academically, I’ve been recognized on the **Dean’s and Merit List for five semesters** and have held leadership roles as Marketing Head in the Entrepreneurship Cell and Robotics Club Head. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and continuously exploring new engineering and science frontiers.
