### About Me

Hello! I'm Aravind Narayanan, a Master of Engineering student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, specializing in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I discovered a deep passion for computer vision, robotics, and deep learning.

My experience spans both academic research and industry projects. I'm currently an Applied ML Intern at the Vector Institute, where I developed VLDBench, a benchmark for evaluating disinformation detection in Vision-Language Models—currently under peer review for ACL 2025. At the Neural Robotics Lab, I created a pipeline for monocular depth estimation to reconstruct 3D scenes. I've also worked at the Laboratory for Applied Informatics Research, integrating eye-tracking systems and LLMs for intelligent news clustering.

Previously, as a Python Developer at the Bernhardt-Walther Lab, I developed pyMLV, a tool for analyzing multivoxel pattern data to understand mid-level visual representations in the brain.

My projects range from GPU-accelerated video processing and reinforcement learning for robotic control to mood classification in song lyrics using GPT models. I’m proficient in Python, C++, MATLAB, and SQL, with hands-on experience in PyTorch, TensorFlow, ROS, and cloud platforms like GCP and AWS.

I’ve been recognized on the Dean’s and Merit List and held leadership roles in student entrepreneurship and robotics initiatives. I'm passionate about using AI to solve real-world challenges and constantly seek to explore new frontiers at the intersection of technology and society.
